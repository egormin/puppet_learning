Puppet interprets any aspect of your system configuration you want to manage (users, files, services, and packages, to give some common examples) as a unit called a resource.
The block of code that describes a resource is called a resource declaration

This resource declaration syntax is composed of three main components:

    Type
    Title
    Attribute value pairs

The type represents the kind of thing that the resource describes
Resource type:
user { 'root':
    ...
  }


Below are some of the core resource types you'll encounter most often:

    user A user
    group A user group
    file A specific file
    package A software package
    service A running service
    cron A scheduled cron job
    exec An external command
    host A host entry


Resource title (title - 'root')
user { 'root':
    ...
  }
